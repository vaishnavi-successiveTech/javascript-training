// 4. Create a class called `Person` that has properties for `firstName`, `lastName`, and `age`. The class should also have a method called `fullName` that returns the person's full name.
//Additionally, the class should have a method called `averageAge` that takes in an array of `Person` objects and returns the average age of all the people in the array.
